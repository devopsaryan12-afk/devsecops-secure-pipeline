## 🧭 Project Roadmap

- ✅ Phase 1 — Application Development & Containerization
- 🔐 Phase 2 — Security Scanning Integration
- ⚙️ Phase 3 — CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
- 🧪 Phase 4 — Automated Testing
- ☁️ Phase 5 — Infrastructure as Code (Terraform + AWS)
- 📊 Phase 6 — Monitoring & Observability


## 🚀 Phase 1 — Application Development & Containerization

### 🎯 Objective
Build and containerize a secure Node.js application as the foundation for a production-style DevSecOps pipeline.

### 🧱 Implemented Features
- Structured Node.js application with modular architecture
- Health check endpoint for service monitoring
- Production-ready Docker container
- Non-root user inside container for improved security
- Clean project structure separating application, docker, and pipeline layers
- Environment-independent reproducible build

### 📁 Project Structure (Phase 1)

 └── src/
     └── server.js

### 🐳 Run Application Locally

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm start

#### Application runs on
http://localhost:8000

#### Commands to build and run docker image
docker build -t devsecops-node-app -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run -p 8000:8000 devsecops-node-app

#### Example Expected output
{
    "message": "DevSecOps Pipeline Running",
    "hostname": "LAPTOP-HFD3BCDR",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-11T17:15:42.335Z"
}
```

## DevSecOps Secure Pipeline – Phase 2 Update

## Overview

This repository contains the updated **Phase 2 implementation** of the DevSecOps secure CI/CD pipeline for our Node.js application.  

In Phase 2, the pipeline is executed **locally inside the Jenkins container**, without using any Jenkins agents. All stages run on the same environment, and workspace cleanup is performed at the start of each run.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Jenkins agents will be introduced in Phase 3 for isolated and scalable builds. Phase 2 focuses on local execution only.

---

## Pipeline Stages (Phase 2)

1. **Cleaning Workspace**  
   - Removes any existing files in the Jenkins workspace to start fresh.

2. **Checkout**  
   - Clones the repository from GitHub into the Jenkins workspace.

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Runs `npm ci` (or `npm install` if lockfile issues) inside `app/` to install Node.js dependencies.

4. **Dependency Scan**  
   - Runs `npm audit --audit-level=high` to detect high-severity vulnerabilities.

5. **Build Docker Image**  
   - Builds a Docker image of the Node.js application using the `Dockerfile`.

6. **Image Scan**  
   - Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities using Trivy.

---

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed and running.
- Node.js installed in the Jenkins container.
- Docker installed in the Jenkins container.
- Trivy installed in the Jenkins container.

---

## How to Run Phase 2

1. Log into the Jenkins container.
2. Use the updated Jenkinsfile for Phase 2.
3. Run the pipeline — all stages will execute **locally**, without any external agent.

---


---

## Notes

- Workspace cleanup ensures a fresh environment for every pipeline run.  
- Phase 3 will introduce Jenkins agents for improved isolation and scalability.
